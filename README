git-upstream is a Python application providing commands to support rebasing of
local-carried patches on top of upstream repositories.

git-upstream provides commands to support usage of git for subjects who need
to integrate big upstream projects in their environment (i.e. feature branch
creation/finishing, release starting/finishing). The operations are performed
using Git commands.

git-upstream is intended to make use of multiple configuration files to specify
project, team and individual preferences. This allows for variations in similar
workflows to be supported, without needing developers from different projects
to be aware of the specific operations need for other projects.
