hpgit is a Python application providing a default workflow for HP Cloud
projects (i.e. feature branch creation/finishing, release starting/finishing)
on top of git. The operations are performed using Git commands.

hpgit can use multiple configuration files to specify project, team and
individual preferences when working on projects. This allows for a number of
similar but slightly different workflows to be implemented, while being
described by the same commands.
