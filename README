hpgit is a Python application providing commands to support usage of git for
HP Cloud projects (i.e. feature branch creation/finishing, release 
starting/finishing). The operations are performed using Git commands.

hpgit is intended to make use of multiple configuration files to specify
project, team and individual preferences. This allows for variations in similar
workflows to be supported, without needing developers from different projects
to be aware of the specific operations need for other projects.
