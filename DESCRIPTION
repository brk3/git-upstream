- What is git-upstream?

git-upstream is an open source Python application that can be used to keep in
sync with upstream open source projects, mainly OpenStack.

The main usecase for this tool is for people who are doing active contributions
to repositories that are mirrors of OpenStack repositories, with the intention
that most of those contributions will be submitted to review.openstack.org at
some point.
If you are running a public cloud based on OpenStack, having local changes
needed to use it in your environment, you can use git-upstream to stay up to
date with the upstream master in a easier way (with respect to using raw git
commands).

git-upstream provides new git subcommands to support rebasing of local-carried
patches on top of upstream repositories. It provides commands to ease the use
of git for who needs to integrate big upstream projects in their environment.
The operations are performed using Git commands.

- What git-upstream is not

The name of this tool includes the "git-" prefix because of the Git naming
convention that a Git subcommand must have. So, as git-review (usually invoked
with "git review [...]"), this tool can be invoked using "git upstream [...]".
That said, and even if git-upstream currently uses Change-Ids, it is not
strictly related to git-review.
In other words, git-review can (and most of the time will) be used without even
knowing about git-upstream existence.
